# Git Deps Test Suite Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive test suite for git-deps covering three main categories of functionality:
- **Warnings**: Cases that should warn but continue execution
- **Errors**: Cases that should fail with non-zero exit codes  
- **Confirmations**: Cases that should ask for user confirmation unless `--force` is used

## Test Structure

### Test Files Created

1. **`tests/integration-warnings.sh`** - Tests warning scenarios
2. **`tests/integration-errors.sh`** - Tests error scenarios  
3. **`tests/integration-confirm.sh`** - Tests confirmation scenarios
4. **`tests/run-all.sh`** - Test runner script for all integration tests

### Warning Test Cases ✅

- Parsing syntax errors in `.gitdeps` configuration
- Extra information/fields in configuration entries
- Duplicate dependency paths in configuration
- Branches/commits referenced that don't exist in checked out repos
- Missing or empty `.gitdeps` files

### Error Test Cases ✅

- Trying to add an already existing dependency (without `--force`)
- Trying to pull a branch that doesn't exist  
- Trying to pull a commit that doesn't exist
- Trying to pull a dependency that has local changes
- Invalid repository URLs
- Missing required command arguments
- Invalid/protected paths for dependencies
- Corrupted `.gitdeps` files
- Repository access denied scenarios

### Confirmation Test Cases ✅

- Pulling dependency with local committed changes that haven't been pushed
- Changing branch/commit of dependency where target doesn't exist in remote
- Overwriting local uncommitted changes
- Interactive confirmation prompts (simulated for automated testing)

## Implementation Enhancements

### Added to `git-deps.sh`:

1. **Warning System**
   - `git_deps_log_warning()` function for orange warning messages
   - Enhanced `.gitdeps` file validation with parsing error detection
   - Duplicate entry detection
   - Branch/commit existence checking with warnings

2. **Confirmation System** 
   - `git_deps_confirm()` function for interactive prompts
   - `git_deps_op_has_unpushed_commits()` to detect unpushed changes
   - `--force` flag support in pull command
   - User confirmation for potentially destructive operations

3. **Enhanced Status Checking**
   - Better revision validation (branch vs commit vs unknown)
   - Remote branch existence checking
   - Warning messages for invalid revisions

## Test Results

- **Warnings**: All tests passing ✅
- **Errors**: All key scenarios implemented and tested ✅  
- **Confirmations**: Interactive prompts working correctly ✅

## Usage

```bash
# Run individual test suites
./tests/integration-warnings.sh
./tests/integration-errors.sh  
./tests/integration-confirm.sh

# Run all tests
./tests/run-all.sh
```

## Future Improvements

Several test scenarios are marked as "not implemented yet" which would require additional development:

1. `remove` command for dependency removal
2. More sophisticated merge conflict handling
3. Enhanced remote repository validation
4. Additional confirmation scenarios for complex operations

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Warning System**: Non-blocking warnings for configuration issues  
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error codes and messages for failure cases  
✅ **Interactive Confirmations**: User prompts for potentially destructive operations  
✅ **Force Flag Support**: `--force` to bypass confirmations  
✅ **Comprehensive Validation**: File format, repository, and revision checking  
✅ **Test Coverage**: Structured test suite with helper functions and proper teardown
